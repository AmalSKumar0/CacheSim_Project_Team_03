Simplified Algorithm (LRU Cache)

step 1. Setup Cache
    Define the cache size, block size, and how many items fit in one set (associativity).
    Calculate the number of sets (buckets) available.

Step 2. Read Memory Address
    Take the incoming memory address from the input list.

Step 3. Find the Location
    Split the address into two parts:
    Set Index: Determines which specific "bucket" to look in.
    Tag: The unique ID of the data block.

Step 4. Check for Data (Search)
    Go to the calculated Set Index.
    Look for the Tag in that set.

Step 5. Handle HIT (Data Found)
    If the Tag is found:
        Count it as a Hit.
        Update Priority: Move the Tag to the end of the list (mark it as "most recently used").

Step 6. Handle MISS (Data Not Found)
    If the Tag is NOT found:
        Count it as a Miss.
        Check Space: If the set is full, remove the oldest item (the one at the front of the list).
        Insert: Add the new Tag to the end of the list.

Step 7. Final Report
    Repeat steps 2-6 for all addresses.
    Print the total Hits, Misses, and the Hit Ratio percentage.
