Step 1.Start

Step 2.Initialize an empty list memory to store pages in frames.

Step 3.Initialize index = 0
       (This points to the oldest page in memory for FIFO replacement.)

Step 4.Initialize page_faults = 0.

Step 5.For each page p in pages, do:

       1.If p is already present in memory:

         ->Report Page Hit.

       2.Else:

         ->Report Page Fault.

           Increment page_faults by 1.

           If the number of pages in memory is less than frames:

             Insert p into memory.

           Else:

             Replace the page at position index in memory with p.

             Update index ← (index + 1) mod frames.

       3.Display the current contents of memory.

Step 6.Display the total number of page faults.
