## 📖 Project Overview
We have developed a **Cache Simulation Tool** that models how computer memory handles data. This project bridges the gap between hardware theory and software practice.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Implemented
1. **Mapping Techniques:** Simulating how memory blocks are mapped to cache lines (Direct, Associative, Set-Associative).
2. **Replacement Algorithms:** Deciding which data to evict when the cache is full (FIFO, LRU, LFU).
3. **Git Collaboration:** Using branching, merging, and version control to build software as a team.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Dynamic Simulation:** Input custom memory sequences to see real-time cache behavior.
* **Performance Metrics:** Automatically calculates **Hits**, **Misses**, and **Hit Ratio**.
* **Visual Workflows:** Includes process flow designs created in **Canva**.
* **Modular Design:** Each algorithm is implemented in separate modules for clarity.
