Start

Read the main memory address A.

Divide address A into three fields:

Tag

Index

Offset

Compute the cache line number using:

Index = (Block Number) mod L


Access the cache line specified by Index.

Compare the Tag of the address with the Tag stored in that cache line.

If tags match:

Declare Cache Hit

Use Offset to read the required word from cache.

Else (tags do not match):

Declare Cache Miss

Fetch the required block from main memory.

Replace the block in the selected cache line.

Update the tag.

Use Offset to access the word.
